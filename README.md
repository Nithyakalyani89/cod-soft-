## To Do List in Python
In this article, we are going to create To do list in python using tkinder.
We are going to implement a simple python to-do list in which we can add a task and delete it when itâ€™s done. We will be using a Python package called Tkinter which is a widely used Python GUI library. It is shipped with python, so we do not have to download or install it separately, we can just import and start with it.

A GUI is basically a medium to interact and present information to the users. One of the major advantages of using Tkinter is that it works well on any machine be it windows, linux, or macOS.
