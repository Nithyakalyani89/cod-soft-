## To Do List in Python
In this article, i am going to create To do list in python using tkinder.
I am e going to implement a simple python to-do list in which we can add a task and delete it when itâ€™s done. I will be using a Python package called Tkinter which is a widely used Python GUI library. It is shipped with python, so i do not have to download or install it separately, we can just import and start with it.

A GUI is basically a medium to interact and present information to the users. One of the major advantages of using Tkinter is that it works well on any machine be it windows, linux, or macOS.

## Steps to develop To-do List Project

1.Import the Tkinter library:
  In the first line, i am importing Tkinter which is basically a standard GUI library in Python and every possible object of it.
  In second line, i am importing ttk from tkinter.
  
2.Create to-do list app window:
   In this we create the class called todolist.
   next step is Naming the window.
   Dimension of the window has been entered.
  * creation of label:
    I have created the labels for the app.
       
3.create Add task:

    Created delete buttons & task using def function.
    Gave font size and color,background ground etc.,
